# S3 simple storage service

## what is it?
Simple storage service(S3) is a global storage platform - however it is considered regionally resilient NOT globally resilient.
 - global in this context means it is available in all of the aws regions
 - **regionally resilient** because data is stored in a specific AWS region at rest
   - data never leaves region unless you explicitly configure it to do so
   - data is replicated across AZs in that region for resiliency

Notice how in the AWS console you cannot select a region if youre viewing S3 services, instead it shows "global"

S3 is ideal for large amounts of data
Considered economical compared to some other AWS storage services

### S3 delivers two main things:

#### **Objects**
 - the individual data being stored, can be a variety of object types
 - two main components:
   - **Object Key** which identifies the object in a bucket
     - can be thought of as a filename
   - **Object Value** is the data or the contents of the object
     - ex. for a cat.jpg object, the binary sequence represting that image is what's being stored
     - object value must be between 0 bytes and 5 Terrabytes
 - additional components:
   - version ID
   - metadata
   - access control
   - subresources

#### **Buckets**
 - buckets are stored in a region 
 - buckets contain the objects
 - bucket names are unique AWS-wide, meaning across all regions and aws accounts
 - hold unlimited objects i.e. infinitely scalable storage solution
 - flat in structure
   - everything stored in bucket at root level
   - no filesystem but can have S3 present objects in a folder-like structure for the console
     - generally considered **prefixes**

**Exam tips**
 - Bucket names are globally unique
   - naming convention:
     - 3-63 characters, all lower case, no underscore
     - MUST start with a lowercase letter or number
     - can't be formatted like IP addr
 - 100 Soft Limit on buckets per account
 - 1000 hard limit per account
 - unlimited objcets in bucket, 0 bytes --> 5TB max
 - Object Key = Name of object
 - Object Value = Data of the object


### S3 Patterns and Anti-Patterns

 - S3 is an object store - not file or block storage type
   - image
   - audio file
   - etc.
 - Non-mountable (such as K:\bucket or /images)
 - great for large scale data storage, distribtuion, or upload
 - VERY COMMONLY used as an input and/or output to other AWS products.
